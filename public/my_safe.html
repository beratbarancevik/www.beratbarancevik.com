					What you need to know prior to this course?
				</h3>
				<p>
					As it is Android platform’s native language, Java knowledge is essential for
					this course. Any other programming knowledge especially in an object-oriented
					language will be useful. Native or hybrid any mobile development experience will
					be very helpful but not required. If you are an iOS user, you might find it
					useful to get yourself familiar with the nature of Android apps as navigation
					and GUI (Graphical User Interface) design in Android apps are quite different
					from iOS apps. This will help you when developing the My Safe app in this
					course. If you are an Android user, this means you are already familiar with the
					feel of Android apps and you do not need to do anything extra.
				</p>

				<p>
					To learn Java the following tutorials are recommended prior to taking this
					course but any other Java tutorial for beginners course of your choice can be
					followed too (all courses are completely free except for Codecademy’s Learn Java
					course which is partially free and all courses have been previously taken and
					recommended by the author of this course):

					The link below will take you to Udacity’s website’s Android apps section where
					you can find more free Android courses that can be followed after you took this
					course. I studied almost all the courses in these tutorials on my own and they
					made me a more complete and more advanced Android developer. All these courses,
					except for one, are prepared and supported by Google and Udacity. Along with
					Lynda.com Android courses, these courses are the most professional and
					comprehensive Android courses that you can find on the Internet. I have
					personally found the courses on Udacity more helpful and educating than
					Lynda.com courses. Plus, to watch Lynda.com courses you need a paid membership
					but they are also great resources to learn native Android app development.

				<h3>
					Necessary tools:
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A computer with Mac OS, Linux or Windows and with Internet connection (other

					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						Android Studio: It is the official IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
						of Android platform and can be downloaded from
						<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html" target="_blank">
							Android Studio’s official website
						</a>
						(preferably the latest version).
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						Java: It is currently one of the most popular programming languages and
						widely used in mobile, web and desktop software development. Java SDK
						(Standard Development Kit) must be on your computer to run Java code and
						programmes. Java SDK can be downloaded from
						<a href="https://java.com/en/download/" target="_blank">
							Oracle’s official website
						</a>
						(preferably the latest stable version).
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						An Android device with minimum Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.3 operating system
						which is going to be the minimum version that our app is going to be working
						on (not compulsory but it is useful and exciting to run your app on a
						physical device rather than on an emulator – Android emulator is a virtual
						Android device that can be installed and run on a computer. Android Studio
						offers a wide range of devices with different operating system versions.
						Operating system versions are always referred as API levels in Android. For
						example, the latest Android version is, as of the time of writing, Android
						Nougat 7.1 which is API level 25).

				</ul>

					Additional Information

				<p>
					The app that is going to be built in this project can be found at
					<a href="https://github.com/beratbarancevik/UCL-Coding-Curriculum-MySafe-Android-Tutorial"
						target="_blank">
						this GitHub repository
					</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you do not know how to use Git and/or GitHub I suggest you to study the
					following tutorial but this is not essential for this course. However, you might
					find version control with Git and GitHub (or any other website that helps you
					with version control) useful when developing your app. It is also an essential
					skill for programmers who work in industry.

					About the Author
				</h2>

				<p>
					I am a second-year undergraduate Computer Science student at UCL. I am
					interested in many areas of software engineering but the one that attract me the
					most is mobile (iOS and Android) application development. The reasons for my
					interest in mobile app development are listed in the next section. I spend a
					good amount of time outside the school on building mobile apps and improving my
					knowledge in mobile app development further. As of the time of writing I have 3
					Android apps on Google Play Store and 1 iOS app on Apple App Store.

				<h2>
					Objective and Description
				</h2>

				<p>
					This project aims to teach native Android mobile app programming through
					building a simple app step by step so that students of this course can get into
					exciting world of mobile app development and improve their programming skills.
				</p>

				<p>
					The app we are building is going to take photos and store them separately from
					the phone's gallery. So the photos are going to be accessible only through the
					app. The app is going to ask for user to set a password when the user opens the
					app for the first time. After that, the app is going to ask the user to set a
					password to access the content of the app.
				</p>

				<p>
					Native mobile app development is quite easy to start by downloading free IDEs
					for each platform and it is very easy to distribute apps through app stores. A
					computer with an Internet connection is enough to start building mobile apps.
					Building mobile apps is a fun and educating way to learn programming and it is
					also what many software engineers do for living. Mobile app developer is a
					very employable job in the UK and in most of the European and North America
					countries.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you are planning to study a computer science or a relevant degree, what you
					will learn in this course will certainly be helpful with your studies. If you
					keep improving yourself in mobile app development you can even work as a mobile
					app developer after or even before you graduate from university. You can easily
					code your own apps too. Even if you are not going to study a computer science or
					a relevant degree in the future, learning programming is still an important
					qualification in terms of learning how to find creative solutions to problems
					and how to take different approaches to solve a problem.
				</p>

				<p>
					This course focuses on solely Android application development rather than iOS
					development. One of the main reasons for that is Java which is the native
					language of Android platform is much more common in non-mobile software projects
					such as web development and desktop application development than Swift and
					Objective-C which are native languages of iOS platform.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another major reason is that Android Studio which is the official IDE of Android
					platform can be run on Mac OS, Linux and Windows whereas, Xcode which is the
					official IDE of iOS platform can only be run on Mac OS. The registration fee for
					Google Play Store is 25$, as of the time of writing, for lifetime and for Apple
					App Store it costs 99$ per year, as of the time of writing. If you want to
					distribute your own app at the end of the course which makes Android a more
					reasonable choice for this course.
				</p>

				<p>
					I hope you will find the course useful and enjoy it. I appreciate any feedback
					to improve this course. I am also happy to answer your questions. So please send
					any feedback or questions to my email address:

					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>
					Outstanding Tasks
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The whole project which is created through lecture series is a big challenge
						on its own.

					</li>
					<li>
						The lecturer explained as much as he could to answer all possible questions
						that the students might have.
					</li>
					<li>
						The lecturer types the code along with explaining it which makes it very
						easy for students to understand the logic behind every code.
					</li>
					<li>
						All lectures can be watched from the project's website.
					</li>
					<li>
						The final app is an engaging and useful app which will help students to
